Sunlight:

Scene 1: A misty forest at dawn. Tall trees stretch upward, their trunks softened by layers of fog. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the canopy, scattering light across dew-covered leaves. The atmosphere is serene, ethereal, and quiet. As the light intensifies, the fog thickens, blooming into a radiant haze that begins to envelop the scene.

Transition: The sunlight grows blindingly bright, filling the frame with glowing brilliance. The forest dissolves slowly into the light, as if memory itself is being washed away. Particles shimmer and drift like fragments of time.

Scene 2: A quiet night. A single lantern glows warmly in the center of the frame, surrounded by dense fog. Its light pulses gently, casting soft shadows into the mist. The lantern emerges from the brilliance, as if born from the forest’s fading light — a beacon of memory, solitude, and continuity.

Mood: Dreamlike, nostalgic, emotionally resonant. The transition feels like light traveling through time — from nature’s awakening to human reflection.





Light bulb glow:

A dimly lit room filled with vintage light bulbs suspended at varying heights. The bulbs flicker gently, casting warm amber glows across dusty surfaces. Slowly, each bulb intensifies — glowing brighter and brighter — until their combined light floods the space with pure white brilliance. Dust particles shimmer in the glow, floating like fragments of memory. The white light softens and fades into misty sunlight, revealing a foggy forest at dawn. Shafts of light pierce through the haze as trees emerge slowly, the atmosphere shifting from artificial warmth to natural serenity. The transition feels like light traveling through time — a passage from interior reflection to external awakening.





Water light

The transition begins with a gentle cascade of rippled light sweeping across the frame — sunlight bending as if refracted through undulating water or rising heat. The first image responds subtly: edges shimmer, contours stretch and compress, as if immersed in a pool of liquid radiance. The ripples intensify, amplifying in frequency and depth, distorting the scene into waves of refracted brilliance. Light fractures and flows, dissolving the image into a shimmering mosaic of motion. At the peak of distortion, time seems suspended — a luminous pause where memory and reality blur.

Gradually, the turbulence recedes. The ripples soften, and through the settling shimmer, fragments of the second image begin to surface — like reflections assembling on a still lake. Each detail emerges with increasing clarity, guided by the calming rhythm of light. As the final ripples fade, the light stabilizes, revealing the new scene in full. The transition feels fluid, ethereal, and emotionally charged — as if the viewer is passing through a veil of refracted time, where light itself becomes the storyteller.




Aurora Veil Transition
A curtain of aurora-like light waves sweeps across the frame.
Colors shift from cool to warm as the scene changes.
Great for magical or emotional tone shifts.
A curtain of aurora-like light waves begins to sweep across the frame — fluid ribbons of color undulating in slow motion. The light dances in spectral gradients, shifting from icy blues and greens to warm ambers and rose gold. As the aurora intensifies, it begins to veil the scene, wrapping the image in luminous folds. The first image dissolves gently into the flowing light, as if being carried away by the waves. Within the aurora’s glow, the second image begins to emerge — revealed through the shifting hues and soft motion, like a memory surfacing from beneath a dream. The transition feels magical, emotional, and timeless — a passage through light itself.


5. Light Particle Swarm
Tiny glowing particles (dust, fireflies, embers) swirl in from the edges.
They cluster mid-frame, forming a glowing mass that wipes the scene.
The second image emerges as particles disperse.
A swarm of glowing particles—fireflies, dust motes, and embers—spirals inward from every edge of the frame, accelerating in graceful arcs. Their golden light intensifies with each pass, swelling into a radiant vortex that expands toward the center. As the particles converge, they ignite into a blinding mass of brilliance, pulsing with heat and memory. The entire frame is engulfed in luminous energy — a supernova of light that dissolves the first image in a wave of shimmering radiance.

At peak brightness, time seems suspended. Then, as the glow begins to recede, the particles scatter outward like fading sparks. Through the dispersing light, the second image begins to surface — revealed gradually, as if emerging from the heart of the explosion. The transition feels cosmic, emotional, and transcendent — a moment where light becomes the bridge between memory and transformation.


6. Overexposure Flash Cut
A sudden burst of white light overexposes the frame.
The first image vanishes in the flash; the second fades in as exposure settles.
Ideal for dream sequences or memory jumps.
