### Prompt 6: Aurora Veil Transition  
A curtain of aurora-like waves of light sweeps across the scene.

### Prompt 7: Light Particle Swarm  
A swirling swarm of glowing particles—fireflies, dust, embers—spirals in from the edges, clustering in the center into a radiant, blazing mass. The light pulses and then explodes, dissolving the scene into shimmering radiance.
